 * Mynta seed nodes

 * These are placeholder entries for a new chain.
 * To bootstrap the network, you'll need to either:
 * 1. Use -addnode=<ip> to manually connect to known nodes
 * 2. Set up DNS seeds and populate this file with your seed node IPs
 * 
 * Each line contains a 16-byte IPv6 address and a port.
 * IPv4 as well as onion addresses are wrapped inside a IPv6 address accordingly.
